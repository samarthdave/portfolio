# My personal blog

## Built with [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) with the theme [Ananke](https://github.com/budparr/gohugo-theme-ananke).

I integrated the theme into the root directory with "cp ./themes/ananke/* . -r" so that the build process would be easier and I could customize all the css a bit easier too. Before this, I had to cd into the themes/ananke/src directory and run a watch process with Webpack and run hugo in the root directory. All credit for this awesome theme given to [budparr](https://github.com/budparr) though!
