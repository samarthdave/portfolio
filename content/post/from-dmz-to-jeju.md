## "fire and fury like the world has never seen"

I had the chance to visit South Korea this summer and it's too bad that that it's known mainly for the unfriendly neighbor that living up North. Granted, there **is** an angry man armed with ICBMs capable of leveling the peninsula there but I'd be lying if I felt as much animosity and tension as the media conveys when I was at the physical border between the two countries.

I bet you came here for the DMZ but S. Korea is so much more than that. But even with its gorgeous national parks and superior infrastructure, our attention goes to the country only when the US is conducting drills there with Korean soldiers or when Kim Jong Un has issued another threat to the White House. And [some of our citizens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ugJZhL-cbc) don't exactly know where North Korea is on a map. Sure, it is cherry-picked but the writers at Jimmy Kimmel sure know which questions to ask people on the streets of LA.

But anyways, here is a summary of my visit to the DMZ and JSA (Joint Security Area). I hope I can keep you reading further though.

## Sir, if you touch the soldier, he WILL touch you back.

Before you read any further though, take a look at this image (no I didn't turn up the saturation; Korea is just that green). It's called Reunification Bridge and it represents hope for a united Korea, one in which all mistakes are forgiven and there is hope for an Earth at peace.

S. Korea has really monetized on this DMZ thing. And for good reason. Where else in the world can you look at a totalitarian dictatorship from which important exports like juvenile bigotry and nuclear arms capture the media on a regular basis?
